# Parameter estimation and modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems based on Runge-Kutta Physics-Informed Neural Network
## Abstract
The repository contains the Python implementation using the PyTorch framework to parameter estimation and modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems based on Runge-Kutta Physics-Informed Neural Network approach. The method, referred to as the Rungeâ€“Kutta Physics-Informed Neural Network (RK-PINN) based on the combination of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Runge-Kutta algorithm. Drawing inspiration from classical numerical integration solution rules for differential equations, a new recurrent neural network architecture is designed for modeling. PINN cells are embedded as the basic integration units of the architecture to introduce prior physics-based biases. The methodology is depicted in the figure below.
